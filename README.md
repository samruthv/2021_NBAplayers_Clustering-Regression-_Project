# 2021_NBAplayers_Clustering-Regression-_Project

  *I am a firm believer that knowledge leads to prosperity and am greatly passionate about education. Not only the education that is received in the lecture rooms, but also the practical, hands on experience one gets during internships and co-ops in between the school year. As a former undergrad student, I have seen how stressful and intimidating trying to land your first internship can be. I wanted to create a model that really shows and understands the vast data of students around the country sending application into the massive void of the job force.*
