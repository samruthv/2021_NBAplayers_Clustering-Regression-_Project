# 2021_NBAplayers_Clustering-Regression-_Project

  *As a huge sports and basketball fan, I wanted to work on a project the involed basketball players and statistics. My goal for this project was to really dive into what seperates ever player interms or play style. This was a challenging iterative tio understand what variable I wanted to use to get the best results for each case. By delving deep into the statistics of the players I was able appriate all my favorite players even more by understaing the crux of there playtyles.*
# NBA players Clustering/Regression Project(Based on 2020/2021 season): Overview
- Used KMeans from sklearn to cluster players to analyse similar play styles, see how good a player is, and determine if the traditional PPG, AST and RPG are good ways to jusge a player.
- Cleaned and organized data in Pandas to create the best possible Data Frame to use for exploratory data analysis and model building.
- Used Seaborn and Matplotib to determine which stats were best fit to use in our clusters and our regrassion models. 
- Created models: Multiple Linear Regression with test and train cases and determined best Height and Weight for Offensive Rebounts and Defencive rebounds in the NBA. 
- Created model the Predicts Points per game but looking at other game and pysical statistics.
